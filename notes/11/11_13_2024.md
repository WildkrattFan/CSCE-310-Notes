Optimal binary search tree
----
___

optimal: when the average number of comparisons in a search is the smallest possible

EX: four keys, A,B,C, and D to be searched for probabilities 0.1,0.2,0.4 and 0.3

what is the average number of comparisons

to find the average number f comparisons, multiply the probability of each by its depth and sum them all

optimal binary search tree computed by dynamic programming

- derive a recurrence 
    - let C(i,j) be the smallest average number of comparisons made in a sucessful search in a binary search tree made up of keys a... where i,j are some interger indicies 1 <= i <= j <=n
    - consider all possible ways to choose a root ak among the keys a...j
    - the root contains key ak, the left subtree, Tk-1 contains key ai....,ak-1 optimally arranged, and the right subtree Tk+1 contains kys ak+1 ..., aj also optimally arranged

- derive recurrence
    - count tree levels starting with one to make the comparison numbers equal to the keys levels

Cost(i,j) = min{pk * 1} + $\sum^{k-1}_{s=i}ps$ * (level of as in T + sum of the probability of search)

= min{C(i,k-1) + C(k+1,j)} + $\sum^j_{s=i}ps$
start where C(i,-i1) = 0 for 1 <= i <= n + 1

Warshall's and Floyd's Algorithm
___

Warshall's algorithm - for computing the transitive colsure of a directed graph

Floyd's algorithm
- for the all-pairs shortest-paths problem

Both of them expoid a relationshios betweena problem and its simpler rather than smaller version
