Union find algorithm
Problem- build a dynamic partition of some n element set S into a collection of disjoint subsets 

- initializes into n on element subsets, each containing a different element of S
    - makeset(x) creates a one element set {x} it is assumed that this operation can be applied to each of the element-s of set S only once

- execute a sequence of intermixed operations 
    - find(x) returns a subset containing x
    - union(x,y) constructs the union of the disjoint subsets $S_x$ and $s_y$ containing x and y respectively an adds it to the collection to replace $s_x$ and $s_y$ respectively
