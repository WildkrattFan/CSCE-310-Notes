Demonstrate that a problem is or isn't solvable efficiently 


P vs NP problems 

definition
- we say that an algorithm solves a problem in polynomial time
    - if its worst case time effeciency belongs to O(p(n)) where p(n) is a polynomial of the problems input size n

- Tractable problems
    - if they can be solved in polynomial time: P problems

- Intractable Problems
    - if they cannot be solved in polynomial time: NP problems 

computational complexity
- classifies the problenms according to their inherent difficulty

Some important facts on computational compelxity 
- cant solve intractable problems in a reasonable amount of time unless input is very small
- very few useful polynomial time algorithms with degree of polynomial > 3
- polynomails that bound running times of algorithms do not usually have extremely large coeffecients
- polynomail functions possess mny convient properties
    - sum and composition of two polynomails are always polynomial too

Class P is a class of decision problems (polynomial class) that can be solved in polynomial time by determinisitic algorithm

Some decision problems cannot be solved at all by any algorithm -> undecidable problems 

Ex: Halting Problem 
- given a compute program P and an input I to it, determine whether the program will halt on tha input or continue working indefinitely on it
