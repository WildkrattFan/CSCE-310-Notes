Hashing
- distributing keys among a one dimensional array (hash table)
    - using a predefined function
        - ex: if keys are nonnegative ints, K mod m
        - ex: if keys are letters of some alphabet we can first assign a letter its position in the alphabet then apply that number to the hash function
        - ex: if K is a sring we can sum each letters position and take the mod of that
best hash functions are seemingly pseudo random

Hash Function requirements
- table size shouldnt be too large compared to number of keys
- hash function needs to distribute keys among cells as evenly as possible 
- hash function must be easy to compute 

every hash scheme must have collision resolution

OPEN HASHING RESOLUTION 
    - keys are sorted in linked lists attached to cells of a hash table

effeciency of open hashing
- depends on lengths of linked list
- depends on dictionary and table sizes
- quality of the hash function

if the hash function distributes n keys among m cells of the hash table about evenly, each list will be about n/m keys long

the ratio n/m is called the load factor of the hash table

CLOSED HASHING
- all keys are stored in the hash table itself without the use of a linked list
     - table size m must be at least as large as the number of keys n

clustering when a hash table is big is bad
- why not put a cluster into a new hash table?

HASHING VS BALANCED SEARCH TREES

Hashing - searching insertion and delection worst case O(n) but on average O(1)

BST: searching insertion and deletion both for worst and average case are O(logn)

Ordering preservation
Hashing: does not preserve ordering of the keys
BST: preserve ordering of the keys
