Change-Making Problem

_____

Give change for amount n using the minimum number of coins of denominations d1 < d2 < ... < dn

- derive a recurrence 
    - let F(N) be the minimum number of coins whose values add up to n 
    - define F(0) = 0
    - amount n can only be obtained by adding one coint of denomination dj to the amount n-dj for j = 1,2,3,...,m such that n>= dj
    - consider all such denominations and select the one minimizing F(n-dj) + 1
    -recursion: min {F(n-dj)} + 1 for n > 0
    - for F(0) = 0

ex: n = 6
denominations 1,3,4

F[amount you need to give change] = min{F[amount you need to give change - demonination < amount you need to give change]....}

The coin-collecting problem 
---
several coints are placed in cells of an n x m board, no more than one coint per cell
- a robot located in the upper left cell of the board, needs to collect as many of the coints as pssible and bring them to the bottom right cell
- on each step
    - the robot can move either one cell to the right or one cell down from its current location
    - when the robot visits a cell witha  coint it always pick up that coin
find the max number of coins the robot can collect and a path it needs to follow to do this

Apply dynamic programming 
derive a recurrence 
- left F(i,j) be the largest number of coins the robot can collect and bring to the cell (i,j) in the ith row and jth column of the board
    - cell(i,j) can be reached from the adjacent cell (i-1,j) above it or from the adjacent cell (i,j-1) to the left of it
    - the largest number of coins that can be brought to these cells are F(i-1,j) and F(i,j-1)
        - assume that F(i-1,j) and F(i,j-1) are equal to 0 for nonexistent neighbors(e.g. above first row or left first column)
    - largest number of coins the robot can bring is the max of these two numbes plus one possible coin at cell (i,j) itself
