Dynamic Programming
_____
General algorithmic design technique for solving problems with overapping subproblems

programming tands here for planning

not limited to special type of problems 9e.g. as greedy was only for optimization

subproblems arise from a recurrence relating a given problems solution to solutions of its smaller subproblems

rather than solving overlapping subproblems again and again, dynamic programming suggests
    - solving each of the subproblems only once
    - recording the results in a table from which a solution to the origional problem can be found

EX: Computer n!

consider the sequence 
1!, 1!, 2!, 4!...n!
1,1,2,6,24...

computed through the recurrence: 
F(n) = n*F(n-1) for n>1 with F(0) = 1

Dynamic programming algorithm
    - smaller overlapping subproblems f(n-1)
    - to compute the answer of the larger problem first solve F(n-1) and combine them to give us the solution to F(n)

EX: The fibonacci numbers: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21

The recurrence is: 
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-1) for n > 1 with F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

ALGORITHM DESIGN STEP(AND CHALLENGE)

- deriving a recurrence relating a solution to the problem to solutions to its smaller subproblems (in previous examples it was given in advance)

Optimization rpbolems are solvabke wuth dynampic programming only if
- principle of optimality - an optimal solution to any istance of an optimization is composed of optimal solutions to its subinstances 

The Coin-Row Problem

Row of n coints whose values are some positive integers c1, c2,...cn not necissarily distincy

GOAL: pick up max amount of money usbject to the constraint hat no two coints adjacent in the initial row can be picked up (you can only take every other coin)

The apply dynamic programming algorithm design strat
- derive a recurrence
    - F(n) is the max amount that can be picked up from the row of ncoints
    - partition all the allowed coint selections intot two groups
    - largest amount from first group: n_n + F(n-2)

max{C2 + F(n-2), F(n-1)}
