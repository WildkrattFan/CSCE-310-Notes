DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
_____
Given a vertex called the source in a weighted connected graph find the shortest paths to all its other vertices

Greedy design strat, works only for undirected and directed graphs with nonnegative weights

finds the shortest paths to a graphs verticies in order of their distance from a given source
    - find the shortest path from the source to a vertex nearest to it then to a second nearest and so on 
    - ith iteration
        - all shortest paths to i-1 other verticies nearest to the soruce (from the source form a subtree T_i of the given graph) are already found
        - the next vertex nearest to the source will be among the verticies adjacent to ther verticies of T (fringe verticies)
