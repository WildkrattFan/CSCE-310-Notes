Warshall and Floyd's Algorithms 
---
___

Warshalls algorithm 
- for computing the transitive closure of a DG

Floyds algorithm
- for the all pairs shortest paths problem

Transitive closure def
- where verticies can be defined as the nx n boolean matrix T = {ij} in which
    - the element in the ith row and the jth column is 1 if there exists a nontrivial path from the ith vertex to the jth vertex
    - otherwise tij is 0

How to obtain transitive closure
    - we can do this using a depth first search of breadth first search starting from each vertex
    - Apply DP design strat

Warshall's Alrogithm
- assume the DG verticies are numbered 1 to n
- construct the transitive closure throough a series of n x n boolean matricies 

General idea: Store whether or not a vertex is connected to another, iterate over them over and over, checking to see if a vertex that is connected to another one is connected to a third one in which case you switch the value within that row and collumn to 1 for that value

All-Pairs shortest path problem
---
___
- Find the distance from each vertex to all other verticies
- all the elements of each matrix are computed from its immediate predecessor
