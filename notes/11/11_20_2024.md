Space and Time Trade offs
----
____

There are trade offs in algorith design

EX; problem of compting values of a funcition at many points in its doman 
- if we care about time, we can recompute the functions values and store them in a table (Dynamic programming)

2 Main techniques
- input enhancements
    - perprocess the problems input or whole in part and store the additiona; info to solve the problem
    - boyer-moore and horspool 
- prestructuring
    - hashing
    - indexing with B-Trees

space and time do not have to compete with eachther in all design situations

they can be algned to minimize both the running time and space consumed
<!-- - ex: DFS and BFS -->

Sorting by Counting 
Given items from 0 to n-1, rearrange them in non-decreasing order

- apply input enhancement algorithm design technique
     - comparison counting sort
    for each element in a list, count the total number of elements smaller than this element 

    record the counts in a table

Distribution counting

given a list of orderable items, bounded by the lowest element and the largest element, rearrange them in nondecreasing order (they may have duplicates)

- if the values of A are below the lower and upper value, compute the frequence of each pf those values and store them in an array F[0,...u-l]

Hashing
--- 
____

Used to implement a dictionary
the elements of this set can be numbers, charaters, strings, etc

Assume we must implement a dictionary of n records with keys k1,k2 etc

hashing 
- distribute keys among a one dimensional array (called hash table)

Hash function needs to statisfy conflucting requirements
- hash tables size should not be too large but also big enough to not affect the time effeciency 
- a shash function needs to distribute keys among the cells of the hash table as evenly as possible
