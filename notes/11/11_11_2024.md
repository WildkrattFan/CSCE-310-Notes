Knapsack Dynamic programming algorithm
___

we assum all the weights and the capacity are positive

the item values do not have to be integers

derive a recurrence 
-   consider an instance defined by the first i items, 1< i < n with weights and values and knapsack capacity j, 1 < j < w 
- let f(i,j) be the vaue of an optimal solution to this instance

Pretty much just see if it is better with or without a certain thing
- first i items can be divided into subsets
    - not including ith item (j-wi > 0) means the optimal subset solution: F(i-1,j)
    - including ith item - optimal subset solution vi + F(i-1,j-wi)
recurrence relation 
max(F(i-1,j), vi + F(i-1,j-wi)) if j-w >= 0 
F(i-1,j) if j-wi < 0

to find the contents go to far right bottom value, if the value above it is less than itthen that means you included that element. If you have the same value then that means that value didnt "win" so it doesnt get included

Memory functions
---
___
The classic dynamic programming works bottom up
- fills a table with solutions to all smaller subproblems
- some of these subproblems are not necessary

Memory functions: only solves subproblems are that necessary
- solve a given problem in the top down manner
- maintains a table 
- initially, all the tables entries are initialized with null
- if a new value needs to be computer, the method checks the corresponding entry in the table first

    - if the entry is not null then the value is return

Knapsack MF Algorithm
___

Optimal Binary search trees
---
DP & optimal binary search trees
___

Used to implement a Dictionary: set of elements with operations of searching, insertion, and deletion
- optimal: when the average number of comparisons in a search is the smallest possible (for a successful search)

ex: four keys A,B,C, and D to be searched for with probabilties 0.1,0.2,0.4, and 0.3
