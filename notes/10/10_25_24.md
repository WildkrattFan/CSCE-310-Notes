Prims algorithm: 
TL;DR imagine you are on google maps and you set a stop to be somewhere besides the final destination, prims algorithm would find the shortest path to both

concept: greedy algorithm, always pick the shortest route to an unvisited node

Kruskal's Algorithm
---
A sequence of locally optimal choices will yield a globably optimal solutions for certain problems

1) Sort the graphs edges in nondecreasing order of their weight

2) Starting with the empty subgraph scan this sorted list, adding the next edge on the list to the current subgraph
    - if such inclusion doesnt create a cycle

how to check if there is a cycle 
    - if and only if the new edge connects two verticies already connected by a path

Union Find algorithm- buld a dynamic partition of some n element set S int a collection of disjoin subsets
----
Given a set of certain elements you want to build a subset given cetain criteria
