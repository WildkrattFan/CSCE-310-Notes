__Things to remember:__
Bolded things are most important
* Stacks and Queues
* How to get from a graph to adjacency matrix and adjacency list
* How to select basic operations when analyzing time complexity -- __It is the operation that is executed more frequently & depends on the input size__
* How $\theta$, O and Omega notation work and be able to express them 
* How to simplify the efficiency function of an algorithm 
* How to solve the time complexity through backwards substitution 
* How to perform different sorting algorithms, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
* Knapsack problem, traveling salesman
* __KNOW HOW TO DO ADJACENCY MATRIX AND ADJACENCY LIST THINGS__ $\leftarrow$ Very Important
* Divide and Conquer strategy __There may be a problem where we have to give the pseudocode for a algorithm that does something divide and Conquer and a brute force version of that algorithm
* Binary Tree Traversal Problems
* Pre-Order, In-Order, and Post-Order
* __Understand how merge sort and quick sort work__ $\leftarrow$ algorithms will be given in exam: Draw a diagram to show how it works
* Decrease and Conquer strategy, such as insertion sort
* Know how to go from directed graph to adjacency matrix and adjacency list
* __Know how to do topological sort__ - start at nodes that don't have any incoming paths and work down, must be a `DAG`
* Do the binary search of a given list
* Selection problem $\leftarrow$ Quick select
* Find the median of an array
* Transform and conquer instance simplification ex: presorting
* Mode calculation
* __AVL tree and how to build them/do rotations on them__
* 2-3 Trees and how to build them (remember that when the bubble gets three numbers it pops)
* __NO B-Trees__
* Bottom up and top down construction of a heap
