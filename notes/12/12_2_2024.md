NP problem (non-deterministic polynomial) - if there is a solution, you can verify that the solution solves the problem in polynomial time

nondeterministic algorithms 

two-stage procedure that takes its input as an intance I for a decision problem and does the following
- guessing stage
- verification stage

NP ocmplete problem - problem in NP that is as diffuclt as any other problem in this class
- any other problem in NP can be reduced to this problem in polynomial time

a decision problem is said to be polynomially reducable if there exists a function that transforms instances of D1 to D2 such that
- t maps yes instances to yes instances D2 and no in D1 to no in D2

a decision problem D is said to be NP complete if
- it belongs to NP 
- every problem in NP is polynomailly reducible to D
