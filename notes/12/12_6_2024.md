What is NP hard?
----
____
Problems that are at least as hard as NP-complete problems

usually problems that have a complexity that is exponential

decision versions are NP-Complete
Optimization versions are NP-hard


Three options to deal with NP- complete problems

algorithms fast in average case- such algorithms use backtracking with substantial pruning

heursitics- methods like simulated annealing r greedy approaches can be used to quickly find a solution with no gaurentee that it will be the best one

approximation algorithms- get close to the optimal answer but not get it
