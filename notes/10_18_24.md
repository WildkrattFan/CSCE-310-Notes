Heap- binary tree with keys assignened to its nodes, one key per node with two properties
- 1 shape property- a binary tree is coplete with all its levels full except possibly the last level where only some rightmost leaves may be missing 
- 2 Parental Dominance

__Suitable for implementing a priority queue__ - Multiset of items with an orderable characteristic called an items priority when a heap data structure implements these effecient operations:

The children fa key in the array is located at the parents positon x 2 + 1 and x 2

__Bottom up heap consntruction__- intialize a essentially complete binary tree with n nodes by placing them in order given

starting with the last parentia node the algorithm checks if the heap property is filled and exchanges the parent with the max of its children if it isnt

Top DOwn Heap construction- by successive insertions of a new key into a previously constructed heap

attach a new node with key k in it after the last lef of the existing heap

sift k up to its appropriate place in the new heap

How to delete the root: Exchange the root's ey with the last key k of the heap. decrease the heap size by 1, heapify the smaller tree by sifting k down the tree (bottom up heap construction algorithm)

time complexity of heap sort - nlogn
