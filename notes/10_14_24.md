Transform & Conquer Horner's Rule and problem reduction
--

Two stages to T&C 
Transformation Stage - 

instance is modified to be more amendable to solution

Conquering stage 

__Representation Change__

__Evaluating a Polynomial__

Problem: Compute the value of a polynomial p(x) = $a_nx^n + a_n-1x^x-1 + ... + a_1x+a_0$
at a point x

used for approximating other types of functions

At the basis of the fast Fourier transform
- Used to convert sounds to notes and how we convert code to music
- Used in pretty much every signal 

We solve it with a representation change
How?
- We sucessively take x as a common factor in the remaining polynomials of dimininishing degrees

ex:

    p(x) = 2x^4-x^3+3x^2+x-5

    p(x) = x(2x^3-x^2+3x+1)-5
         = x(x(2^2-x+3x)+1)-5
         =.....
to compute at x = 3 substitute x in at the inner most paranthesis and keep going until you have no more xs

Pseudocode

    input an array P[0...n] of coeffecients of a polynomial of degree n stored from the lowest to the highest an a number x
    output: a value of the polynomial at x
    p <- P[n]
    for i <- n - 1 down to 0 do:
        p <- x * p + P[i]
    return p

Time complexity:
Input size is the numbr of coeffecients 
Basic operation- either multiplication or addition
Yes depends only on input size

$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 1$ $\theta(n)$

__Problem reduction__

- If you need to solve a problem, reduce it to another problem that yo know how to solve

Least common multiple
two positive integers m and n denoted lcm(m,n) is defined ats the smallest integer that is divisible by both m and n


You can use GCD to calculate the lcm which is ${m * n }/ {GCD(m,n)}$


Counting Paths in a graph 
- number of different paths of length k > 0 from the ith vertex to the jth vertex of a graph (undirected or directed)

equals the (i,j)th element of $A^k$
-  A is the adjacency matrix of the graph

Problem of counting paths $\rightarrow$ problem of computing power of its adjacency matrix

Maximization (minimization) problem
- find a max or min of some function f(x)
- I know the algorithm for function minimization 

max f(x) = -min(-f(x))

__Linear Programming__

Optimizing a linear function of several variables subject to constraints in the form of linear equations and linear inequalities
- problems of optimal decision making can be reduced to an instance of linear programming problem

ex: University needs to invest 100 mil split into stocks, bonds, and cash
expect annual return of 10%, 7%, and 3%

stocks are more risky than bonds: endowment reules require the amount invested in stocks to be no more than one third of the money invested in bonds

At least 25% of the total amount invested in stocks and bonds must be invested in cash

How should the managers invest the money to maximize returns 

let x,y,z be the amounts invested in stocks

maximize .10x + .07y + .03z

x + y + z = 100

Reduction to graph problems
- State space graph: verticies represent possible states of the problem, edges indicate permitted transactions among such states
- One of the verticies represents an initial state and another or multiple represents a goal state of the problem


__HeapSort__ 

Stage 1 - construct a heap

Stage 2 - Maximum deletions
