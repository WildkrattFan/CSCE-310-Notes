Greedy Technique
------

Greedy algorithm design strat- start with bigger values and go smaller

constructing a solution through a sequence of steps, eac expanding on a partially constructed solution obtained so far until a complete solution to the problem is reached

on each step a choce is made that is:

* feasible: must satisfy the problems constraints
*  locally optimal: must be the best local choce among all feasible choices vailable on that step
* irrevocable, once made it cannot be changed on subsequent steps of the algorithm

ex: find the minimum number of moves needed for a chess knight to go from one corner of a 100x 100 board to the diagonally opposite corner
